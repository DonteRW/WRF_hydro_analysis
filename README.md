# WRF output for hydrology analysis
Creates statistical data with the results of the  WRF simulations, over WRF simulated area and desired number off stations with coordinates location.

This tool is used to have a critical analysis over the WRF with hydrology outputs results, so user can study the hydrology in that particular area.

Work in progress!!!

**To implement:**

* Compare data obtained from Stations and WRF simulation

## Results:


## Usage:

* Run:
```r
make run
```

* kill application:
```r
make kill
```
